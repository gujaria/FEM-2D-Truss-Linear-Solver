# FEM Solver for 2D Truss Elements

FEM implementation in Java 
•	Implementation of linear FEM with 2D Truss elements and Triangle plane strain elements in Java.
•	User is asked for input co-ordinates of elements as well as the boundary conditions for load and displacement and the code outputs the calculated displacements.
•	The code calculates the Global Stiffness Matrix and then does the reduction for the same using the local node numbers of the individual elements and boundary conditions.
